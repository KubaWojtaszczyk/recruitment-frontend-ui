# Tonik - Recruitment task for Front-end UI developer

> Your job is to implement a simple landing page based on the provided project. It can be found in the `_files` folder. All needed graphics are in a `_files/assets` directory.

Make a fork and proceed to make changes. Remember to commit after each stage to clearly show all changes. When you finish, please send us an address to your repository.

## Tasks to be accomplished

1. Configure project builder using your tool of choice (NPM scripts/Gulp/Webpack)
2. Elements of graphics in "Aperiam ducimus, repellendus" and "Optio quidem iusto" sections have to be composed separately (in HTML/CSS). They cannot be inserted as a single image
3. Implement slider for cards in "Asperiores" section. The slider should center itself on the clicked card and accordingly update dots navigation. Keep it simple, no looping or swiping events
4. Make website responsive. There should be at least one breakpoint
5. Optimize website assets. Make sure that media files are lightweight

## Make these assumptions

- Use SASS to build your stylesheets
- Do not use any external CSS or JavaScript libraries/frameworks

## Bonus points

- Apply BEM naming convention and OOCSS methodology for your SASS
- Use JavaScript ES6 syntax and split code into modules
